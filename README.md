# Version Control System

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It will be only for text files.

## Getting Started

This will be a c++ based project with concept on file handling. Anyone can simply execute the program to run VCS.


## Branching strategy

   Only owner of the repo has the rights to update master branch.
   No one will work directly in master branch.
   Contributer will work on seperate branch and then ask for pull request.
   
## Functions of VCS :
   initialization
   add
   commit
  
 ### Try to implement :
   status
   log


Try to handle exceptions after MVP
